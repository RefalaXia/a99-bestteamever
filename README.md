## Project
We built a game system that is composed of a user login system and a snake game. Users must sign up for an account to play the game. User information will be stored and validated by the database (API Documents [here](docs:API_Documents)). Only correct pair of user name and password can successfully log in to the system and start to play the game. Inside the game, users can play the game multiple times, and the highest score will be recorded. If the user wants to exit, he/she can simply click the logout button and exit. Next time, the user still has to enter his/her account information to enter the system.
